# parallaxserialrfid

A C++ library for using [Parallax's Serial RFID Reader](https://www.parallax.com/product/28140) with the [Intel Edison Arduino Breakout board](https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/hardware/edison/documentation).  

Relies on [libmraa](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa) so with some slight modification of the GPIOs should be portable to RaspberryPi or Beaglebone.

Build on device, makefile builds an example.
